# Illustrate basic functionality


This document was generated with isoreader version `r packageVersion("isoreader")`.


```{r}
#iso_omit_files_with_problems()
```

```{r}
#iso_cleanup_reader_cache()
```

The underlying isoreader package requires unique file names within a dataset so files with the same name cannot be combined into a list of iso_files. Appropriate warnings will be triggered if this happens accidentally. It is generally recommended as a best practice to setup IRMS instrumentation such that data files are automatically generated with a unique prefix (e.g. an incremental universal run number).



```{r}
set.seed(123)
data_frame(
  analysis = 1:10,
  prep = c(rep("a", 3), rep("b", 4), rep("a", 3))
) %>% 
  arrange(analysis) %>% 
  mutate(
    new_sample = prep != c("", head(prep, -1)),
    batch = cumsum(new_sample)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(batch) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg = mean(analysis)
  )
```
